SCREENSHOT PLACEHOLDER

For the actual theme, you'll need to replace this text file with a screenshot.png image.

Recommended specifications:
- Filename: screenshot.png
- Dimensions: 1200×900 pixels
- Format: PNG
- Content: A representative screenshot of the theme showing its design and features

The screenshot.png file is displayed in the WordPress admin when users are browsing themes.

You can create a screenshot by:
1. Setting up a demo site with the theme
2. Capturing a screenshot of the homepage or a key page
3. Resizing to 1200×900 pixels
4. Saving as PNG format
5. Replacing this text file with the image

Note: WordPress will automatically create a thumbnail version for the theme selection screen.
